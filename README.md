# ImagineBook 
<sub>(reads as "image in book")</sub>

This mod allows you to add images to your books. Mod is fully client-side so you can add images even on servers, and other mod users also will see them.

You can use https://imgur.com/ or some services to upload images

You can add image even if you don't have mod installed using mod's image format: [url,x,y,width%,height%,rotation°]

Some parts of mod use Access Wideners, at some point other dev started to use Accessors. I am lazy to port his code to AW, so use whatever you want
